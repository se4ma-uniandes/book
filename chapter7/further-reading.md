# 7.6 Further reading

Being knowledgeable of the different architectural styles is a *must* for software architects and engineers. It does not matter if your focus is web apps, or mobile apps, etc. If you are interested on a deeper explanation of architecture styles you should read:

* _Chapters 3 and 4: Paul Clements et al. **Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond**, 2nd Edition, Addison-Wesley Professional, 2010._

A cool book about design patterns is the Head First Design Patterns book. You will find it very interesting. It is one of the must-read if you want to write good code:

* _Bert Bates, Kathy Sierra, Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson. **Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide**, O'Reilly Media, 2009._

There is also a cool quick reference by Mark Turansky that summarizes the GoF design patterns.

* [Quick reference to GoF design patterns, part 1](http://blog.markturansky.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/designpatterns1_sm.jpg).

Rozansky's and Bass' books are good references for learning architectural tactics:

* _Nick Rozanski, Eoin Woods. **Software Systems Architecture**, Addison Wesley, 2005._

* _Len Bass, Paul Clements, Rick Kazman. **Software Architecture in Practice**, 3rd edition, Addison Wesley, 2012._
