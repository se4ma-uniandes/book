# 11.4 Final thoughts
___

We will never get tired or reminding you that performance really matters in mobile apps. So, be careful of avoiding and mitigating any of the performance bugs we described in this chapter. Performance is the jewel of the crown in mobile development because performance issues are one of the top user reasons for uninstalling mobile apps. 

However, knowing the bugs is not enough. You have to kill them !!. So, in the next chapter you will read about some of the existing techniques for improving the performance of mobile apps. In your development process make sure that you and your teams devote enough time to implement the performance-related practices, and to continue measuring/profiling your app behavior. Keep in mind also fragmentation, thus, measuring/profiling in only one device is a bad practice that you should avoid. Fortunately, we have tools that automate the performance measurement process.  See you at the next chapter.
