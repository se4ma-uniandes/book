# 5.1 The platforms war: Android GUI components vs iOS GUI components
___

We were talking about the difficulty of having a generic design that is expected to work in both Android and iOS metaphors. So, in the following table you will find a comparison of some of the GUI components from Android and iOS metaphors. These are common components used in many applications and we want you to have an idea of how different or similar the components are. In each line of the table you can find an example (picture) of the component, a component description, and a link to a webpage in which you can see more information about each component.

| Component        | Android Component|iOS Component  |
|-----|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Bottom Navigation Bar | ![Bottom Navigation Bar](../assets/UI-Components/BottomNavigationBar.jpg)<br>(ScreenShot from: [Material io](https://material.io/components/images/content/57018c7e5e35e656acbdca49193b1f11.svg))<br> It is called **Bottom Navigation Bar**, normally located on the bottom part of the screen. In some cases it could be found in the top of the screen if there is another element that is in the bottom part. If the device is a tablet, the bar is located in the left side of the screen.
