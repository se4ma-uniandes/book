# 5.1 'Good to Go:'_ Let's explore the Design Systems
___

We were discussing the challenge of creating a generic design that can function seamlessly across both Android and iOS platforms. In order to find solutions and strive for some consistency between designs, we must begin by familiarizing ourselves with the design systems or UI kits of Android and iOS.

Let's remember that design systems are fundamental tools for developers and designers aiming to create consistent and effective user experiences on mobile devices.

The design systems of Android and iOS are not just sets of static guidelines; they are dynamic tools designed to *streamline the design process* and *enhance the user experience*. These systems provide a range of pre-designed components, such as buttons, navigation bars, and typography, along with guidelines on their usage and behavior.

By adopting these systems, developers can ensure that their applications adhere to the design standards set by Google and Apple, ensuring a **cohesive and familiar appearance for users**. Additionally, they facilitate the implementation of best design practices and help to mitigate usability and accessibility issues.
