# 5.1 'Good to Go:'_ Let's explore the Design Systems
___
Let's remember that design systems are fundamental tools aimed at creating consistent and effective user experiences in any software product.
So, first, let's ask ourselves ... Are design systems just for operating systems?

The answer is no. Design Systems exist not only for platforms or operating systems, but also for companies that want to have a recognized brand that can be identified by any client or user. For example, some well-known ones are [IBM Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/), [Decathlon Design System](https://www.decathlon.design/), and [Airbnb Design System](https://airbnb.design/). In these Design Systems, companies define their appearance and identity for any software product. First, the branding: logo, colors, typography, icons, style of illustrations or photographs. Second, all the components such as buttons, inputs, titles, cards, dialogues, chips, dropdowns, navigations, animations, etc. And finally, the way to distribute and use all these components: the patterns, layout, grid, margins, sizes, locations, etc.

In this way, if the company has several software products, such as web pages, marketplaces, mobile apps, and/or why not? ... XR apps (like in the case of Apple with Apple Vision Pro), etc. All these products will be designed with the same "shared language" and guidelines, and the new designers and developers won't have to reinvent the design, but they will also use the Design System to maintain the identity, consistency, and user experience.

Many Design Systems are open and allow designers to use them as a reference. This implies that they can also use the software components and modify colors and some properties to adjust them to their product and brand. For example, IBM Carbon is Open Source and has an open community, both in design and implementation of the components. In this way, we can find Figma resources of each Design System (also called UI Kits) to use as a reference:

Now you already know that big companies create their own design systems, as this helps them with consistency, UX, and scalability (of their app designs).

So... when you have your own startup or work in a large company, you will know what a design system is, how to use it, and why it's important. However, now, when designing your app for the course, you won't create a complete design system from scratch. Instead, you will use Material Design (by Google) or the Human Interface Guidelines (by Apple) as a basis for creating your app's identity.

## Why use a Design System in your Mobile App?

We were discussing the challenge of creating a generic design that can function seamlessly across both Android and iOS platforms. In order to find solutions and strive for some consistency between designs, we must begin by familiarizing ourselves with the iOS and Android design systems.

The design systems of Android and iOS are not just sets of static guidelines; they are dynamic tools designed to *streamline the design process* and *enhance the user experience*. These systems provide a range of pre-designed components, such as buttons, navigation bars, and typography, along with guidelines on their usage and behavior.

By adopting these systems, designers and developers can ensure that their applications adhere to the design standards set by Android and iOS, ensuring a **cohesive and familiar appearance for users**. Additionally, they facilitate the implementation of best design practices and help to mitigate usability and accessibility issues.
