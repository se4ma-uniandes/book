# 5.2 Designing-GUI-Mocks
___

Now that you understand the two dominant design metaphors for mobile apps, it is time for getting your hands dirty, by creating some GUIs.

But... we are Engineers, we don't know about designing graphic interfaces, at least the real ones... that is what you could be thinking. And the answer is YES!, for most of us we do not know about graphic design. Even so, we can make some real graphic interfaces to show a mock of the app that we are working on.

We can think about two main concepts in GUI design. The first is the **UX model**; it is the design of the navigation flow in the app, is the _what_ are we going to show and _where_ are we going to do it. And the **UI model** that is _how_ I want the user to do the things defined in the UX model. The final product of a UX Model is a Wireframe of the application, while the final product of the UI Model is a Mockup of the application. Check this article for more information about the difference between UX and UI [An App Entrepreneurâ€™s Guide to Mobile UX and UI Design](http://www.launchpadapps.com.au/blog/mobile-app-ux-ui-design/)


Usually, the bigger problem is to go from the UX model to the UI model. And there are two main components that will help you to do that, colors and fonts. And here are some tools that can help you to choose both of them. While a UX model does not care about colors, icons and fonts, a UI model does care about it.

## Colors

You can choose random colors for your app and continue with the other work, but that's not a good idea. Choosing a color palette is a very important decision, and it depends on visual aesthetic facets such as the colorfulness, the emotions you want induce in your user (e.g., hope, passion), and the craftsmanship. In the field of color theory there are several strategies for defining a color palette (e.g., harmonies, monochromatic sets, etc.)

There are tools that can help you visualize and create your own color palettes and there are other tools that can help you choose the right colors. Here we list the ones that we used before (coolors is the coolest one):

## Fonts

Selecting the right font is also a difficult task. There are so many Fonts that it is impossible to look them all. By simplicity you can use the fonts recommend by the design metaphors (Roboto for Android, and San Francisco for iOS). If you wanna be bold and select your fonts, we recommend you to use the following tools:
