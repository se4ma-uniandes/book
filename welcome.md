# Mobile App Development

### _\(a.k.a., Software Engineering for Mobile Applications\)_

---

In the last decade there has been an impressive increment on the number of mobile devices and apps that are used for daily activities. As of January 2017 the number of mobile apps available in the official iOS market were 2,23 million[^1] , and as of June 2017, the number of app downloads raised to 180K millions[^2]. _What are the reasons for such an impressive numbers?_ Think for a few seconds on the reasons \[...\]

One of the main reasons for the success of the mobile ecosystem \(apps, devices, services\) is the possibility of ubiquitous computing, which provides human with the power of having access to their information/data and computing capabilities everywhere. The wide set of sensors and data acquisition components supported by mobile devices are a very appealing feature that users enjoy not only for having fun, but also for online banking  and health monitoring (among other tasks and daily activities).

Another reason is the existence of online app markets that allow users to easily browse and download apps directly to their devices with a simple click. Both, Google play \(the official Android app market\) and Apple Store \(the official market for iOS apps\) accounted for more than 5 million apps \(as of January 2018\). This is an impressive number, which represents a huge market for \(i\) users that expect to find apps that support their daily activities, and \(ii\) developers that expect to reach a large set of app consumers.

However, the existence of the online markets and the high demand for mobile apps do not assure that a new mobile app will be successful. Another component in the "success" recipe is to design and implement high quality apps that are able to deal with the design constraints imposed by the devices, operating systems, and programming models. In this book we will explore mobile app development from a software engineering and architecture perspective. We will cover very relevant concepts related to mobile software development \(starting with app conception and finishing with testing\), and best practices/guidelines to deal with quality attributes such as performance, eventual connectivity, security, among others.

So, go for a coffee, a shai, ice tea, soda, or any of your favorite drinks and then start to enjoy this book with a very cool chapter about the mobile ecosystem.
