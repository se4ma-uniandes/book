# 9.2 Data Storage types
___

As you probably learned in previous courses when we talk about data storage types, we have two main categories, relational databases and NoSQL collections (databases). But when we use each type, well we have to take into account some aspects to make these types of decisions.

### Relational databases

Nowadays exists many relational  databases, some of them are Oracle database, MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, DB2, etc..,  


Some characteristics of these databases:

* These types of databases became popular in the 80's.
* They are grounded in a mathematical model (set theory).
* The language used to create structures and access to the data is a declarative and standardized language- Structured Query Language (SQL)
* These types of databases have a defined schema. The information is saved in relationships (tables), each table has attributes (columns) and tuples(rows).
* We can update, insert, remove data, and read from a single table data very efficiently, but joining information from multiple tables can cause overhead making this operation expensive and inefficient, which reduces scalability.
* These types of databases must have ACID properties.


>Remember that ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

### NOSQL
These types of databases emerged due to the low scalability of relational databases and also in response to some challenges of data such as volume, velocity, and variety. These types of databases support sharding, clusters, replication, and, in general, they do not meet ACID properties.

In NoSQL databases we have different types:

* Key-Value
* Graph
* Document
* Column Family

> Remember that NoSQL does not mean NO SQL it means Not Only SQL.

Some general characteristics:

* These types of databases are schema-less, meaning that the schema needs to be verified while reading the data (schema-on-read).
* High availability and fault-tolerance mechanisms.
* These types usually meet BASE properties, that stands for Basically Available, Soft State, Eventual consistency.
* Low cost.
* The data is accessed through an API.

**Key-Value** storages the data as a dictionary (an identifier called key and a respective value). You can read, insert and remove easily but you cannot partially update data.

 Some databases:
 
  * Aerospike
  * Cassandra
  * CouchDB
  * Redis
  * Riak


**Document** storages the data as nested pair key-value data. The group of key-value pairs elements are called a Document, each document can have a specific schema (flexible schema).The document can easily parsed to XML or JSon. You can insert, delete read and also update partially.


Some databases:

  * MongoDB
  * ArangoDB
  * RavenDB
  * Amazon DocumentDB
  * Firebase

**Column Family** they look some kind of similar to relational tables, but they contains columns of related data. It is composed as a key-value pair, where the key is mapped to a value, and the value is a set of columns. 



Some databases:

  * Cassandra
  * HBase
  * HyperTable
  * Amazon SimpleDB

**Graph** they are purpose-built to store and navigate relationships. They are composed with nodes and arcs. The nodes model entities while the arcs model the relationships between nodes.

Some databases:

  * Neo4J
  * OrientedDB
  * InfiniteGraph

### When selecting a db....

It is important to have in mind:
