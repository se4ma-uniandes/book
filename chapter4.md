The [agile modeling](http://www.agilemodeling.com/) approach by Scott Ambler, proposes that multiple models should be used to define and design what a software system does. Because agile modeling follows the values and principles from the agile manifesto, agile modeling is an iterative and incremental process that focuses on lightweight modeling. Multiple models exist in the design and software engineering toolboxes, however, creating as much models as you can does not mean that you are going to have a better design. The power of modeling is in using the right ones, and as agile modeling suggests, using lightweight models depending on your purpose and the product.


This chapter is about models.... but not the ones in the collage. It is about models you can use to design your app. Remember that a model is not only a diagram. A model is also an sketch or textual descriptions. In addition to describing personas and the context, you should describe the business questions your solution will answer, and how personas will interact with your app. This chapter is about those models: the VD map and scenarios descriptions.
